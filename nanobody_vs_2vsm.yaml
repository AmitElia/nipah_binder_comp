# Nanobody binder vs Nipah G (2VSM) — corrected to mirror working protein spec
# Run with:
#   boltzgen run nanobody_vs_2vsm.fixed.yaml --output boltzgen_out_10000_nano/nanobody_vs_2vsm_nanobody-anything #       --protocol nanobody-anything --num_designs 10000 --budget 10
#
# Notes:
# - Added an explicit designable binder entity so 'Total designed residues' is > 0.
# - Binder length range mirrors the working mini-protein pattern; protocol 'nanobody-anything' will apply VHH-specific logic.
# - Target residues use the same binding list as your working protein_vs_2vsm.yaml.

entities:
  # Designable binder (length range). The nanobody-anything protocol will shape this into a VHH-like binder.
